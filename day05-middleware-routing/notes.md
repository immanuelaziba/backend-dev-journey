## 🔧 What I Built Today
- Broke routes into separate files using `express.Router()`
- Used `app.use()` to register route groups
- Handled undefined routes with a 404 middleware

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Clean code by separating routes into modules
- Mounted routers with base paths
- Implemented global middleware for request logging and error handling

## 🔁 What I’d Do Differently
- Use `dotenv` to manage ports and config next time
- Add more routes (e.g., POST, PUT) to test modular handling

## 🔮 What’s Next
Learn about Express error-handling middleware and begin using `dotenv` for better environment control.
