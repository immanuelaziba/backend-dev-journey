## 🔧 What I Built Today
- A script that logs system info to a `.log` file using `os`, `fs`, and `path`.
- A basic HTTP server that returns "Hello, World!" using the `http` module.
- A small file utility to write and read text using the `fs` module.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to gather system data (CPU, memory, uptime) and save it in `.log` files.
- How to use Node.js to create a basic web server from scratch.
- How to read from and write to files asynchronously.

## 🔁 What I’d Do Differently
- Consider wrapping async operations in `try/catch` with promises for better error handling.
- Add timestamps or logging enhancements for better output tracking.

## 🔮 What’s Next
- Explore npm and external packages.
- Build a CLI app or utility using one or more npm packages.
