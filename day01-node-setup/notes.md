## 🔧 What I Built Today
Ran my first Node.js script. Practiced basic terminal use and verified installation.

## 🧠 What I Learned
Node can run JavaScript outside the browser using the terminal.

## 🔁 What I’d Do Differently
Start new projects with `npm init -y` to prepare for future package installations.

## 🔮 What’s Next
Explore Node’s built-in `fs`, `path`, and `os` modules tomorrow.
