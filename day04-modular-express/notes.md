## 🔧 What I Built Today
- Separated user routes into their own module using `express.Router`.
- Used `app.use()` to mount modular routes.
- Refactored the server.js for better project structure.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Modularization keeps code clean and manageable.
- Express Router helps scale your backend app by organizing endpoints.
- Middleware like `express.json()` is essential to parse request bodies.

## 🔁 What I’d Do Differently
- Add more route files (e.g., `/posts`, `/comments`) to simulate a real project.
- Create a utilities folder to handle repetitive logic.

## 🔮 What’s Next
- Add error handling middleware.
- Use environment variables with `.env` and `dotenv` package.
- Connect to MongoDB and move from in-memory storage.

✅ Objective:
Improve backend project structure with modular routes and prepare for database integration.
